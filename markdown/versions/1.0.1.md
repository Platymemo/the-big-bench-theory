### v1.0.1
1. Fixed KubeJS Compatibility (and added examples to the GitHub)
2. Fixed #c:crafting_tables tag
3. Fixed Shapeless recipe to actually be able to take up to 81 ingredients
    * (Originally could only take the vanilla 9)
4. Fixed the algorithm to generate REI displays for Shapeless Recipes to account for all 1-81 possible input sizes
